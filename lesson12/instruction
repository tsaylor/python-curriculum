# Comparison Operators and Booleans #

For reasons we shall see shortly, sometimes we need to know if a statement is true or false.

Try in the Python shell:

    >>> 6 > 4
    >>> 6 == 6
    >>> 6 != 6
    >>> True and True
    >>> True or False
    >>> not True

All these expressions return a *boolean*, which is a *data type* that has a number of special uses. All the boolean operators are listed [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not).
