# Square Brackets #

If you want to get a character in a certain position in a string, you can use square brackets.

    >>> "Hello World"[0]
    "H"
    >>> "Hello World"[-1]
    "d"
    >>> "Hello World"[1:7]
    "ello W"
    >>> "Hello World"[1:9999999]
    "ello World"
    >>> "Hello World"[1:]
    "ello World"
    >>> "Hello World"[1:-1]
    "ello Worl"
    >>> "Hello World"[0:-1:2]

If you imagine a number above each character in a string, you can access a character or set of characters through the square brackets using the associated numbers. The numbers are called the index, and accessing the string through the square brackets is called *indexing*.
