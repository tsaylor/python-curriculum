# Variables #

Python can store a value and name it so you can use it later in your program. This is called a *variable*. Any type of value can be assigned to a variable with the `=` operator.

    >>> number = 7
    >>> print number
    7
    >>> name = "Chewbacca"
    >>> print name
    Chewbacca

Variables can be used in the same ways as the values we were using before.

    >>> name + ' and Han'
    'Chewbacca and Han'
    >>> name.swapcase()
    'cHEWBACCA'
    >>> print name
    Chewbacca

Notice that the variable was unchanged by the previous commands. To replace the value of the variable with the value returned from `.swapcase()`, you would have to assign that value back to the variable, like this:

    >>> name = name.swapcase()
    >>> print name
    'cHEWBACCA'
