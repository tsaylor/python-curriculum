# HOMEWORK Exercises: #

1. Write a program that splits a restaurant bill and calculates the tip. Write a prompt to enter the bill total, the tip percentage, and the number of people who will be splitting the bill, and output the bill and tip amounts for each person.
2. Ask for someone’s favorite food. Use the [] operator sing them a version of the C is for cookie song. (as a bonus use the * operator or variables to shorten your code for the repetitive portions of the song)
3. Use the [:] technique for finding bits of a string to write a program that sings "The Name Game" song (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_Game) You can assume for now that the name given is one word and begins with a consonant.
4. Write a program to prompt you for a comma separated list of values (like 'a,b,3,c') and print that list reversed. Then print it with the last value first, but the rest in the order they were entered.
4. If you want to write some more programs, try out some of the exercises on some of the many online python resources: codingbat, udacity, and codecademy are some great places to look.



# Cliff Notes version: #

Python has many data types. We learned about numbers (like 7, -1, and 30298092.34) and strings (like "apple", "ball", and "super dee duper")

You can use normal arithmetic operators on numbers (like +, -, /, and *)

There are many methods on strings. You can look for the ones you want in the docs at docs.python.org, or use Google.

In order to find a sub-string or part of a string you can use the [] or [:] syntax. ("foo"[0] is ‘f’, "food"[-1] is ‘d’, and "foodmonster"[4:9878] is "monster")

You can use variables to store and reuse data.

You can save programs in files so that it is easy to re-run the same code.

Lists can be used to store multiple items.
