# Manipulating Strings #

Python can manipulate strings with some of the math operators. Try these:

    >>> "hello" + "world"
    "helloworld"
    >>> "spam " * 3
    "spam spam spam "

When you add or multiply strings together it's called *concatenation*. 

Python strings also have functions you can call to manipulate them. Let's see what some of them do:

    >>> "hello world".capitalize()
    "Hello world"
    >>> "hello world".title()
    "Hello World"
    >>> "hello world".islower()
    True
    >>> "Hello World".islower()
    False
    >>> "Hello World".swapcase()
    "hELLO wORLD"

There are many more string functions listed [in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods). Look them over and try a few out. Also try using the built-in len() function on a string. It returns the length of the given string.

    >>> len("hello")
    5
