# Saving Programs #

As your programs get longer you'll want to save them, so weâ€™ll move to a text editor. Save the following program as "hello.py" in your text editor of choice.

<div class="file"><div class="name">hello.py</div><div class="content">
    name = raw_input("What is your name?\n")
    print "Nice to meet you " + name
</div></div>

In the system shell, move to the folder where you saved hello.py with the `cd <folder name>` command. Run your python program with `python hello.py`.

    $ cd my_programs
    $ python hello.py
    What is your name?
    <type in your name>
    "Hi <your name>"
    $

Try writing a longer program and running it.

<div class="file"><div class="name">oldmcdonald.py</div><div class="content">
    # Sing Old McDonald
    print "Old McDonald had a farm"
    print "Ee i ee i oh"
    print "And on his farm he had some chickens"
    print "Ee i ee i oh"
    print "With a cluck cluck here"
    print "And a cluck cluck there"
    print "Old McDonald had a farm"
    print "Ee i ee i oh"
</div></div>

Let's modify the program to use variables for the animal and the sound it makes.

<div class="file"><div class="name">oldmcdonald.py</div><div class="content">
    # Sing Old McDonald
    animals = "cows"
    noise = "moo moo"
    print "Old McDonald had a farm"
    print "Ee i ee i oh"
    print "And on his farm he had some " + animals
    print "Ee i ee i oh"
    print "With a " + noise + " here"
    print "And a " + noise + " there"
    print "Old McDonald had a farm"
    print "Ee i ee i oh"
</div></div>
