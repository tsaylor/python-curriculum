# Python in Interactive Mode #

## Open your computer's command line interface ##

<div class="two_col">
<div class="left_col">
### Windows ###
Open the run dialog (Windows key + r) and run the command "cmd". A window will open with a prompt like this:

    C:\>

</div>
<div class="left_col">
### Mac ###
From the spotlight, search for "terminal" and run the application. A window will open with a prompt something like this:

    username@computername:~$
</div>
</div>

This is the *system shell*. You will use this to run the Python interactive interpreter and Python programs. In this document, we will represent commands intended to be run in the system shell with the `$` character, like so:

    $ <command to be run>

## Open the Python interactive shell ##

At the system shell, run the following:

    $ python
    Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

You will see something like the output above. The `>>>` is the prompt for the Python interactive shell. You can think of this as an interactive Python program. You can execute Python statements and see the result immediately.
