# Conditionals #

You may want your program to behave differently depending on the input, for example maybe it is your birthday today.

    answer = raw_input("Is it your birthday? ")
    if answer.lower() == "yes":
        name = raw_input("What is your name? ")
        happy = "Happy Birthday to "
        print happy + "you"
        print happy + "you"
        print happy + name
        print happy + "you"
    else:
        age_string = raw_input("How old are you? ")
        print "I am also " + age_string + " years old"

In this example, the `if` statement checks the value of `answer`, and runs one block of code or the other depending on its value. Only one block is executed, not both.

You can combine multiple `if` statements with an `elif`, like this:

    answer = raw_input("Is it your birthday? ")
    if answer.lower() == "yes":
        name = raw_input("What is your name? ")
        happy = "Happy Birthday to "
        print happy + "you"
        print happy + "you"
        print happy + name
        print happy + "you"
    elif answer.lower() == "no":
        age_string = raw_input("How old are you? ")
        print "I am also " + age_string + " years old"
    else:
        print "You can't answer " + answer + " to a yes or no question!"
