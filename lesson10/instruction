# Lists #

In addition to having data types that store one piece of information. Python has data types which store a multiple items.

    >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']

The indexing syntax we used on strings also works with lists:

    >>> s = "some string"
    >>> s[1]
    'o'
    >>> s[1:3]
    'om'
    >>> letters[1]
    'b'
    >>> letters[1:3]
    ['b', 'c']

You can get the length of a list using the len() function like you can with a string:

    >>> len(letters)
    3

You can do other things to lists as well:

Add an element

    >>> letters.append("z")
    >>> print letters
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'z']

Remove an element

    >>> letters.remove("z")
    >>> print letters
    ['a', 'b', 'c']

Test to see if an element is in the list

    >>> "a" in letters
    True
    >> "w" in letters
    False

You can use lists to store anything youâ€™d like:

    >>> string_list = ["tomatoes", "cheese", "milk"]
    >>> boolean_list = [True, True, False]
    >>> mixed_list = [5, "words", False]
    >>> nested_list = [5, ["words", False]]
