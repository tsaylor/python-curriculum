# Loops #

Sometimes you might want to do something more than once in your program. You can use a `for` loop to do that. Try the code below. (To get out of your for loop in the python shell, enter a blank line.)

    >>> for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
    ...     print i
    ...

It ran your print statement once for each item in the list, and referred to that item with the variable `i`. What if you didn't have a pre-defined list though? With a `while` loop you can keep executing a block of code until a condition is met.

    >>> i = raw_input("starting number: ")
    >>> i = int(i)
    >>> while i > 0:
    ...     print i
    ...     i = i - 1
    ...
