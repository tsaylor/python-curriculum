1. Write a function called `mysum()` that takes in two numbers and returns their sum. [BONUS] What happens when you give this function two strings or two lists?
2. Write a function called `first()` that returns the first letter of a string. What happens when you pass the function the empty string ("")?
3. Write a function that takes a word and prints out the word five times.
4. Write a function that takes a string and a number as arguments and prints out the string the given number of times with a space between each. (Hint: You probably will print out one more space than you will need. As a bonus, see if you can figure out a way to avoid that.)
5. Write some code that calls that function, and asks for user input to select the word.
6. Write a function that takes a temperature and converts it from Fahrenheit to Celsius. (Hint: C = 5/9 (F-32))
