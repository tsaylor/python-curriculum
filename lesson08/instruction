# Input #

You can get Python to prompt you for a value with the `raw_input()` function. Write a statement to ask for your name, and then to say hello to yourself:

    >>> name = raw_input("What is your name?\n")
    What is your name?
    <type in your name>
    >>> print "Hi " + name
    "Hi <your name>"
