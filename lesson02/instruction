Let's start with some simple math in the Python shell. Run the following:

    >>> 1 + 1
    2
    >>> 1 - 2
    -1
    >>> 2 * 2
    4
    >>> 6 / 3
    2
    >>> 2 ** 3
    8 

Each of these math expressions is evaluated, and the result is displayed on the next line.  The `**` operator is for exponents; two to the third power is eight.
